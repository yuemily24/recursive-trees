# CSC148 Assignment: Modelling CS Education research paper data
Modelling computer science education research paper data with Python through the usage of recursive trees. Run through the treemap visualisation tool to get a interactive graphical representation of this data.

This is my code for an assignment in CSC148: Introduction to Computer Science at the University of Toronto. My solution received an A+. This assignment demonstrates an understanding of:
- Advanced tree structures (QuadTree, 2-D Tree)
- Recursive tree methods, including insertion and deletion
- Object-oriented programming
